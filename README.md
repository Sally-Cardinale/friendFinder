# friendFinder

FriendFinder is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder"/dating application. 

This is a full-stack site which takes in results from user surveys, then compares the 
answers with the existing users and displays the best overall match. 

To get started with this application, the user will need to install the following:
- Node.js 
- express
- path
- nodemon (optional)

To get help with this project the user can refer to the documentation in npm.

When initally visiting the FriendFinder <strong>HOME PAGE</strong> they will see the following:

To take the survey and be matched, the user will press the "Survey" button and be taken to the following survey page:

![friendFinder-survey](/images/friendFinder-survey.png)

Once the user completes the survey the data will be compared to the existing friends in the friends.js file and a modulus
will appear showing the user their "best match".
